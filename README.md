# jax-pmesh

A JAX-compatible port of the [pmesh](https://github.com/MP-Gadget/pmesh) library, designed for parallel mesh-based computations with GPU/TPU acceleration and automatic differentiation support. This implementation brings the flexibility and performance of JAX to pmesh, enabling efficient scientific simulations and data analysis workflows.

## Design Overview

This library is structured around key components for working with density and particle fields, including dataclasses, generators, operators, and painting utilities. For a detailed breakdown of the system architecture, refer to the [Design Document](docs/DESIGN_DOC.md).
